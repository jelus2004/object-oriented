# Description

# Adding files to git

When you add a file to your source code, you can decide to share it and save it with GIT.
Once a file is shared with GIT you can then save versions and track versions of the file.
This is very handy to check what changed between two commits.

**Remember that until you've added and committed a file to GIT then it won't track version changes!!**

**Remember that until you push your commits to the remote GIT repository, then you won't see them in github!!** 

# Maven project
